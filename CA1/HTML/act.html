            <ol>
                <li>One of the most efficient ways to contribute to a sustainable
                    future is by reducing our personal carbon footprint.</li>
                <li>Embrace Energy Efficiency: Make a commitment to reduce energy consumption in your daily life.
                    Switch to energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights when not in use, unplug electronics, and
                    adjust your thermostat to conserve energy.</li>
                <li>Choose environmentally friendly modes of transportation
                    whenever possible. Walk, bike, or use public transportation instead of relying on personal vehicles.
                    When buying vehicles buy hybrid or fully electric vehicles.</li>

                    when possible, and recycle responsibly.</li>
                <li>Compost organic waste and choose reusable alternatives
                    to single-use items like bottles, bags, and cutlery.</li>
                <li>Opt for digital copies of documents and emails
                    rather than printing them.</li>
                <li>When ordering/buying food only buy what you can eat instead of buying alot and
                    throwing away the leftovers.</li>
                <li>Bring reusable bags when grocery shopping instead of using plastic bags. Use
                    cloth napkins or reusable handkerchiefs instead of disposable tissues.</li>
                <li>Donate or sell items you no longer need instead of throwing them away.

# FED-Websites
Websites that I have created as part of my FED Module assignments

## Website 1
This website comprises three webpages that I created as part of my FED(Front End Development) module in SP's DISM course. The first page introduces the creator, providing insights into their background and interests. The second page advocates for a sustainable future, outlining essential goals individuals can adopt to contribute positively to environmental preservation. Lastly, the third page highlights Singapore Polytechnic's commendable efforts toward environmental sustainability.
p.s This is also the very first website that I created and this is not responsive. Recommended to use a screen of size 1920 x 1080

## Website 2
Similar in theme to the first website, this project presents a four-page website enriched with dynamic elements. Leveraging Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.The initial three pages mirror the content of the first website, delving into personal, societal, and institutional sustainability initiatives. Additionally, the fourth page introduces a feedback form, allowing visitors to engage interactively with the website.I wasn't assigned to develop the backend functionality for the form, so it doesn't submit the data to a server.
